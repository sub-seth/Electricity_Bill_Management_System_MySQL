8. AdminUser (UserID, Username, Password)
    UserID: Primary key uniquely identifying each admin user.
# Justification for Normalization:
The final normalized schema follows best practices of database normalization to eliminate redundancy, ensure data integrity, and optimize data storage and retrieval. Here's the justification for the normalization:
1. Customer, Meter, and AdminUser entities are in 1st Normal Form (1NF):
    Each attribute contains atomic values.
    Primary keys are defined for each entity.
2. Meter, BillingRate, BillingCycle, and AdminUser entities are in 2nd Normal Form (2NF):
    There are no partial dependencies within the entities.
    All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.
3. MeterReading entity is in 3rd Normal Form (3NF):
    The ReadingValue and ReadingDateTime depend solely on the ReadingID, which is the primary key.
4. Bill and Payment entities are in 3NF:
    The TotalConsumption and TotalAmount in the Bill entity are calculated values based on meter readings and billing rates.
    PaymentAmount and PaymentDate in the Payment entity are specific to each payment transaction.
By achieving normalization, the schema avoids data duplication, minimizes update anomalies, and supports efficient data retrieval and manipulation operations. It promotes data consistency, accuracy, and scalability within the Electricity Bill Management System.
